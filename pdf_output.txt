6. After Hours/ Emergencies

6.1 AFTER HOURS/ EMERGENCY CALLS

Crandall Enterprises is pleased to provide our residents with 24 hour Emergency Service. Hopefully, you’ll never need this service, but if
you do, you will certainly appreciate our trained service staff.

Emergency Service is just that: service we provide to you in the event of a true emergency. We have developed a response procedure for
emergencies and other situations that arise during non-business hours. We believe that if you know what to expect from us, you’ll be better
prepared to deal with an unexpected event.

NOT an after hours emergency…. Lack of AC, hot water, or a clogged drain are not emergencies at 9pm (or 3am). Report them to the office
through your portal and they will be reviewed within 8 hours, regardless of the time or day.

Emergencies

No Heat
This is only an emergency in extreme cold weather in winter time and when the heater is not working due to mechanical malfunction. If
your gas or electric is shut off for non-payment of your bill, call your electric or gas provider.

No Electricity in your Apartment
Blown fuses are not considered after-hours emergencies. Please familiarize yourself with your fuse panel and/or breakers.

Electrical outage may be considered an emergency ONLY if there is no electricity throughout the unit AND:

• you have called the Electric company and is not at fault
• you have checked all circuit breakers by flipping them hard to the OFF position and then hard to the ON position and have reset any
and all GFI breakers (these are the little buttons sometimes found on outlets in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, and garages) OR
any fuses have been checked and replaced if burned out.

Partial outages do not constitute an emergency. If a wall switch or outlet begins to smoke or smell like it is burning, turn off the switch or

7

unplug items from the outlet and turn off the circuit breaker or remove the fuse, then report the problem on the tenant portal.

Gas Leaks or “Smell of Gas”
Please contact Center Point at 1-800-227-1376. If you suspect an appliance is leaking gas, turn off the appliance and turn off the gas supply to
that appliance (you should be able to find a shut-off handle somewhere on the supply line). And not everything that smells like natural gas,
actually is.

Flooding

Please put a request through the tenant portal if there is risk of damage to possessions or the property and you cannot contain the leak. Turn
off the water valve to the broken pipe or to the exterior water main, if you can locate it, until a contractor arrives. Do everything within
your power to contain any leaking or flooding and, if necessary, contact other residents who may be affected by the leak.

Fire
Call 911 first!! Then call us.

Total stoppage of the plumbing drain system
If your plumbing drain system ceases to work, none of your sinks, tubs or toilets will function properly. The stoppage of one toilet or drain
when other bathrooms are functional is not an emergency, see below. Any other “Life-Safety” or “Property Protection” issues arising from
storm damage or criminal damage to the property.

Not Emergencies

No Hot Water
This may be considered an emergency ONLY if there has been no hot water for an extended period of time: days not hours. In the event of
no hot water, and it is not during a contractor’s normal business hours, we may be unable to repair the problem in as timely a manner as we
would like, so be resourceful in the meantime.

Clogged or Backed Up Toilet
This may be considered an emergency ONLY if there is only one toilet in the unit AND you have made every effort, including plunging, to
clear the stoppage yourself. In any case, turn off the valve behind the toilet, shut the lid and clean up any mess – due to health issues Crandall
Enterprises representatives will generally not begin work until the area is cleaned up and essentially free of bacterial contaminants.

Noise Complaints or Security Issues
Please contact the Police @ 911. (If the problem is not serious enough to involve the Police, you still may wish to make us aware of it, so we
can address the issue properly, by emailing us at crandall-enterprises.com

Air Conditioning
Failure of the AC system is NOT an emergency. Please report the problem on the portal.

Locked Out or any problem involving your lock and/or key

If you lock yourself out of you will need to call a locksmith. Lock-outs are not after hour emergencies. THE LOCK MAY NOT BE CHANGED.
If you are locked out during normal office hours, please call the office. The lock out fee is $75 and must be paid upon unlocking the door.
